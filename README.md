# Algorithms_FisherYatesShuffle
This program read in a Text file that contains the numbers 1-20.
The file data is then read in using Stream Reader.
File data is added to a list.
The list is then sent into the Randomize method that leverages the Fisher-Yates Shuffle.
The Fisher Yates shuffle's goal is for every iteration to be equally likely random.
